I wanted a quiet corner of the internet where I could keep track of what I am
learning, the questions I am asking, and the people who are helping me along the
way. This blog is the living notebook for that ongoing project.

Here is how I think about using this space right now:

- **Research journal.** Short posts capture experiments, Boolean network
  sketches, and the hunches I want to revisit later.
- **Explainers.** When an idea becomes clear enough to teach, I’ll write the kind
  of post I wish existed when I first encountered it.
- **Letters.** Sometimes an update will read more like a note to a friend,
  because most of my work is shaped by conversations.

I imagine the tone here staying personal, even when the topics get dense. If you
have thoughts, disagreements, or resources worth sharing, please send them my
way. The internet is more generous than we think when we show up as ourselves.

## Why I'm writing here

This blog is my place to make sense of the systems that shape our world — and
the ones that shape me.

I’m deeply fascinated by complex systems: how cells make decisions, how
networks propagate influence, how incentives move economies, and how people
navigate love, responsibility, and the messy work of becoming better versions of
themselves.

Most of my days are spent inside Boolean networks, cell-fate models, and
computational biology. But I’m also learning economics, game theory, and
optimization — trying to understand how coordination problems appear everywhere,
from molecules to markets.

Here, I’ll share:

- research notes from systems biology and network science
- small code projects exploring how we can use networks to understand or solve
  real problems
- ideas from economics, incentives, and game theory
- reflections on papers I find exciting in science, complexity, or behavior
- and occasionally, my life — love, growing up, expectations, mistakes, and
  becoming a better partner and future parent

I’m not trying to sound like an expert. I’m just learning in public, thinking
out loud, and documenting how my interests slowly converge into something
meaningful.

If you’re curious about any of these things — welcome. This is my lab notebook
for the brain, the heart, and everything in between.
