I finally set up a personal blog. 🎉  

The goal of this space is simple:

- Collect notes from my research in systems biology and Boolean networks  
- Write in public about ideas I’m still figuring out  
- Document the journey of building things (papers, tools, maybe startups)

What you can expect here:

- Short “lab notebook” style posts on things I’m learning  
- Longer explainers on concepts like attractors, robustness, control  
- Occasional posts about life, career, and learning

If you’re reading this and we don’t know each other: hi 👋  
I’m Ferio, and I’m trying to understand complex systems without losing my mind.
