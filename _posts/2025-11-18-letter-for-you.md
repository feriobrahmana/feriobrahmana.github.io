Hi friend,

I have been thinking about how to write letters that feel like invitations
rather than broadcasts. This is a template I am trying out for future notes.

## Where my head is at
- What I’m reading right now
- A question I can’t stop turning over
- The experiment I’m running with my own habits

## What I’m making
- Research updates or code snippets worth sharing
- Early drafts or diagrams that could use another pair of eyes
- Tools, essays, or collaborations I’d love to explore

## What I’m asking from you
- A pointer to someone working on adjacent problems
- A book, paper, or poem that shaped how you think
- A reminder to rest, stretch, hydrate, or laugh

If any of this resonates, feel free to reply, send a DM, or just keep reading in
silence. I appreciate you being here either way.
