I wanted a quiet corner of the internet where I could keep track of what I am
learning, the questions I am asking, and the people who are helping me along the
way. This blog is the living notebook for that ongoing project.

Here is how I think about using this space right now:

- **Research journal.** Short posts capture experiments, Boolean network
  sketches, and the hunches I want to revisit later.
- **Explainers.** When an idea becomes clear enough to teach, I’ll write the kind
  of post I wish existed when I first encountered it.
- **Letters.** Sometimes an update will read more like a note to a friend,
  because most of my work is shaped by conversations.

I imagine the tone here staying personal, even when the topics get dense. If you
have thoughts, disagreements, or resources worth sharing, please send them my
way. The internet is more generous than we think when we show up as ourselves.
